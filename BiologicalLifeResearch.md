# Brain Areas #

**Approach of defining areas**:
  * make areas functionally named and identified
  * do not create thalamus area to avoid mixing unrelated paths, assign thalamus nuclei to other areas
  * do not create limbic area to avoid mixing unrelated functions, assign limbic components to other areas
  * take into account all subcortical nuclei and ganglia
  * all areas mapped by Brodmann placed in cortical category
  * consider only single left hemisphere
  * consider area as set of groups of regions and links which serve similar function, with area corresponging to providing this function in several circuits (groups)
