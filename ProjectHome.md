# a(rtificial)Human - This is about Artificial Life #

aHuman project is aimed to create alive being existing by means of software program.

Project has been started in the middle of 2008 and went through stages of initial development.
It is mostly related to computational neuroscience, and though not being a scientific project, it uses strong biological and computer science background.

Now aHuman has rich research pages, useful to start learning the field of neurobiology and approaches assisting to build brain from the scratch as a software program.
Several generations of aHuman architecture reflect certain maturation of the project.

From the very beginning, the ultimate goal of building the program is promoted by creating and supporting compilable and runnable code, which reflects current architecture and well-established findings of research. Download the code (Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition), build and try it.

aHuman is not just a smart program, but a person.
This person might not be a superficial intellect, but it could have a feeling and all features of new-wave artificial intelligence - emergent intelligence, embodiment, continuous learning.

The question is what humans can obtain from that idea? Any case, no military applications (see [there](antiMilitary.md) why).
For now we see possible cases where Artificial Human can succeed:

**1. House Spirit / aWee**

He can live inside your home computer, care about it, about himself and even about you if you become the friends. He has pre-existing knowledge - so you do not need to teach him how to press a button for a simple confirmation window or scan file tree.
He never will be the same on different computers or in different time.

**2. Clone Yourself / aYou**

Having communications with this creature, you can transfer your own features and feelings, so that this program will think and wish to behave as you - so be your clone. He can then help you with simple tasks doing them in the same manner as you.

**3. Artificial Pets / aCat & aDog**

It is a friend, that lives in the internet, artificial cat or dog,
that responds to your actions and has complex state, accumulating experience of communication with you. It can be implemented as chargeable business service in the Internet.
The difference with tamagotchi is that it will have neural nature
with unlimited depth of adoption to you and with natural feelings.
Still the interface is limited to pre-defined set of sensors and possible actions.

**4. Call Center**

...

**5. Industrial Control**

...

**6. Fair Sales**

...

Well, that is not easy, and nobody knows that it is possible and how much time we need to succeed.
