This page is intended to explain aHuman project page set to let you known where what can be found. Also it is a tool to ensure that pages are not trying to duplicate each other and cover project area in a reasonable way.

# Home Page #

  * Google Project Home is http://code.google.com/p/ahuman/ leading to site home page [Home](Home.md)
  * goals and generic approach for the project are explained on [ProjectVision](ProjectVision.md)
  * approaches to allow many people to research and create aHuman program across internet are listed by topic in Tools and Procedures section
  * high-level division of aHuman research area into sub-areas can be found in the middle column named Research
  * finally, Development column describes important activities regarding creation of the program - technical design, coding and testing

# Tools and Procedures #

  * [JoinProject](JoinProject.md) explains how to become a project member
  * [ProjectCommunications](ProjectCommunications.md) lists used techniques to communicate across team
  * [DevelopmentEnvironment](DevelopmentEnvironment.md) helps to establish development environment and do the coding
  * [CodeStyleGuide](CodeStyleGuide.md) and [DesignStyleGuide](DesignStyleGuide.md) establish some limitations on coding and design
  * [ResearchCycle](ResearchCycle.md) and [DevelopmentCycle](DevelopmentCycle.md) present procedules to participate in specific research and development respectively
  * [ProjectTeam](ProjectTeam.md) - is a page where each project member can present himself

# Research #

  * [BiologicalLifeResearch](BiologicalLifeResearch.md) - high-level components and curcuits of human biology. One of severe aHuman project principles is to make use of biological architecture where possible
  * [ArtificialLifeResearch](ArtificialLifeResearch.md) - concepts of creating personality and feeling by means of software program
  * [ArtificialIntelligenceResearch](ArtificialIntelligenceResearch.md) - approaches of creating intelligent behaviour
  * [NeuralNetworksResearch](NeuralNetworksResearch.md) - creating Neural Networks engine, which will be able to represent any required neural network with appropriate structure and characteristics
  * [NeoCortexResearch](NeoCortexResearch.md) - create model of neocortex, which is the foundation of intelligence as per current neurobiogy data
  * [SensorsResearch](SensorsResearch.md) - modeling generalised sensors as foundation for any specific target sensor element
  * [MotorResearch](MotorResearch.md) - modeling generalised effectors and related proprioceptors as foundation for any specific target motor element
  * [ArtificialIntelligenceDictionary](ArtificialIntelligenceDictionary.md) - attempt to collect various terms to point to areas of further understanding and possible use
  * [Library](Library.md) - list of printed books, which can play significant role on understanding the project. It does not mention numerous articles, which are stored in [svn subtree](http://code.google.com/p/ahuman/source/browse/#svn%2Fresearch%2Farticles)

# Development #

  * [ProjectPlanning](ProjectPlanning.md) - project implementation plan
  * [Architecture](Architecture.md) - components and curcuits of aHuman
  * [Specs](Specs.md) - component-level design information
  * [TestFramework](TestFramework.md) - test and debugging techiniques and tools
  * [Creatures](Creatures.md) - considered aHuman targets
  * [Features](Features.md) - valued features implemented by aHuman components
  * [ExternalKnowledgeBase](ExternalKnowledgeBase.md) - third-party code used
  * [RelatedResearchProjects](RelatedResearchProjects.md) - collection of external projects in aHuman project area
